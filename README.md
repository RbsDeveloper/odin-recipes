# odin-recipes

This is my first Odin project, i'll start it thanks to git so i practice a little bit how to create a new repo on github and how to clone it on my pc. After that i will create a very basic website to highlight and practice what i've learned about the HTML in the Foundations course from The Odin Project. Later i'll also practice with css to style this webpage.
